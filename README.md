# V Campus Management System

The **V Campus Management System** is a digital platform designed to streamline administrative tasks and communication within a university or school environment. It integrates web and mobile applications to enhance the student, faculty, and admin experience by providing real-time access to schedules, course management, notifications, and resource allocation.

# Project Title: V Campus Management System

## Domain: Education (University/School Campus)

## Problem Statement
Many educational institutions struggle with inefficient administrative processes, scattered communication, and lack of a centralized system for managing student records, schedules, and notifications. This project aims to provide a Smart Campus Management System that integrates student profiles, course schedules, faculty management, notifications, and resource allocation in a single platform.

## Individual Scope (Feasibility Justification)
The feasibility of this system lies in its ability to leverage modern web and mobile technologies for real-time data management and user interactions. The project will focus on:

- **A web dashboard** for admins and faculty
- **A mobile app** for students to access schedules, receive notifications, and interact with faculty
- **A database** to manage student records, courses, and resource allocations
- **A notification system** to send alerts about timetable changes, deadlines, and important events
